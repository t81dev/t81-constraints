# FAILURES AND LIMITS

This file records constraints that bounded, invalidated, or deprioritized
lines of inquiry across the t81dev ecosystem.

## Observed Limits
- Binary host overhead frequently dominates local ternary gains
- Memory periphery and sense circuitry erase theoretical density advantages
- Noise margins and voltage headroom constrain ternary memory viability
- Hardware zero-skip benefits require sparsity that is workload-specific
- Economic efficiency often fails before semantic efficiency does

## Rejected or Deprioritized Directions
- Global ternary replacement architectures
- Claims of inherent speedup without workload specificity
- Density arguments excluding full periphery accounting
- Security claims without formal cryptographic review

## What Would Change These Conclusions
- End-to-end measurements including host, periphery, and energy costs
- Independent replication under different hardware assumptions
- Demonstrated economic advantage at system scale
- Formal proofs where applicable (e.g., cryptography)

Absent such evidence, these limits stand.
