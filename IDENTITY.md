# IDENTITY — t81dev

`t81dev` is a falsification-oriented research constellation exploring whether
balanced-ternary semantics survive real-world constraint accounting when admitted
locally into binary-host systems.

This organization does not pursue replacement of binary computing.
Binary remains sovereign for control, interoperability, and economics.
Ternary semantics are admitted only where they provide local semantic clarity
under specific, measurable load.

## Non-Goals
- Not a platform, product, or commercial roadmap
- Not a claim of universal speed, density, or efficiency gains
- Not advocacy for ternary hardware or post-binary systems
- Not proof of inevitability or superiority

## Boundary Condition
If ternary semantics are ever justified, it will be for local clarity under
specific semantic load—not for global speed, density, or replacement of
binary systems.

## Rule of Claims
A claim exists only if it survives full-system accounting,
including periphery, host costs, noise, energy, and economics.
Anything else is illustrative.
