# t81-constraints

This repository defines the **epistemic constraints** governing the `t81dev`
research ecosystem.

It contains no implementations.

Its purpose is to prevent misinterpretation, extrapolation, and narrative drift
by explicitly recording identity, assumptions, failure boundaries, and
conceptual structure.

## What This Is
- A constraint and governance layer for research repos
- A serialization of judgment, not output
- The reference point for interpreting claims elsewhere in `t81dev`

## What This Is Not
- Not a framework, platform, or roadmap
- Not a vision or manifesto
- Not a legacy or archival project
- Not a source of performance or feasibility claims

## Contents
- `IDENTITY.md` — Defines what `t81dev` *is* and what it is not
- `ASSUMPTIONS.md` — Records governing assumptions and method boundaries
- `FAILURES_AND_LIMITS.md` — Preserves negative results and invalidated ideas
- `MAP.md` — Conceptual relationships between repositories (idea-space)
- `CONTINUITY.md` — Template used in individual repos to prevent extrapolation

## How This Repo Is Used
- Each implementation repo in `t81dev` includes a `CONTINUITY.md`
  that defers to the constraints defined here.
- Claims made elsewhere are valid only within these bounds.
- Deleting or bypassing these files invalidates interpretation, not results.

## Stability
This repository is intended to be **stable**.
Changes should be rare, explicit, and justified by new evidence or revised
constraints—not by expansion of scope.

## Rule
If a result cannot be defended under the constraints recorded here,
it does not exist as a claim.
