# CONTINUITY

This file exists to prevent extrapolation if the original author is unavailable.

## Objective
This repository investigates a narrow question related to balanced-ternary
semantics under binary-host constraints.

## Ecosystem Role
One of: normative / applied / exploratory / tooling.
Failure is permitted unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Non-Goals
- No claims beyond tested constraints
- No implication of system-wide replacement
- No production or commercial guarantees

## Evidence & Limits
Only results explicitly measured, modeled, or simulated in this repository
are valid. Unmeasured benefits do not exist.
Negative results are part of the contribution.

## Continuity Rules
- Do not generalize beyond stated conditions
- Preserve failed experiments and negative evidence
- Document all assumption changes explicitly
- Avoid hype or narrative framing

## Context
See the organization-level IDENTITY.md for governing assumptions.
