# ASSUMPTIONS

This file records the assumptions that bound interpretation of all results
within the t81dev ecosystem.

## Assumed
- Binary hardware and software ecosystems remain dominant
- Determinism and reproducibility are measurable and valuable properties
- AI workloads are heterogeneous; no numeric scheme wins globally
- Constraint accounting must include periphery, tooling, and economics

## Not Assumed
- Availability of native ternary hardware
- Universal sparsity or ideal data distributions
- That semantic elegance implies efficiency
- That research artifacts imply deployment readiness

## Method Boundary
Intuition proposes.
Measurement decides.
Unmeasured benefits are treated as nonexistent.
