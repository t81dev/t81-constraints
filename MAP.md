# CONCEPTUAL MAP — t81dev

This map describes relationships in idea-space, not build-space.

## Normative (defines rules and semantics)
- t81-foundation
- specifications, whitepapers, interface contracts

These establish language, constraints, and validity conditions.

## Applied (works under stated constraints)
- t81lib
- ternary (T3_K quantization)
- inference integrations and tooling

These demonstrate practical use without implying universality.

## Exploratory (explicitly allowed to fail)
- ternary-fabric
- ternary-memory-research
- ternary-pager
- ternary-delta

These test hypotheses and often terminate in negative results.

## Tooling / Plumbing
- ternary_gcc_plugin
- build, conversion, and analysis tools

These support experimentation and are not claims.

## Cryptography (experimental, high caution)
- trinity
- trinity-pow
- trinity-decrypt

These explore constructions and must not be treated as standards.

Only normative layers define rules.
Exploratory layers do not imply feasibility.
